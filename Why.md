I want to learn Machine Language out of curiosity, or I believe it is essential when you want to become a software engineer.

Machine Learning sounds like very technical but I trust Lambda School will make it easy to understand. When I browse for online jobs since I want to work from home, I do see many job posts looking for coders who know Machine Learning. I believe those who are good at it have brighter future.

The only danger I find with learning ML is when I won't be able to catch. Hope not to happen though.

I'm good so far. Thomson Comer seems serious but a bit funny. I think he likes to joke at times, which makes me feel comfortable and say, "Oh, this gonna be alright."
